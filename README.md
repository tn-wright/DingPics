# DingPics

World of Warcraft add-on to automatically screenshot when you level up.

This version of DingPics requires ElvUI to function properly. After levelling up, the add-on closes the world map, the character frame, and the ElvUI bags if they are open, moves the camera, takes the screenshot, and resets everything to the way it was. 

Each screenshot is taken slightly later than the level before to create a 30 frames per second slideshow.

## Install

Download the folder and extract in `BattleNet\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns`. Make sure the folder is called `DingPics` and not `DingPics-master`.
